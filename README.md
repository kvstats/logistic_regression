# Likelihood of Violence at Protests in North America

A political demonstration is an action by a mass group or collection of groups of people in favor of a
political or other cause. Political demonstrations can also take form of people protesting against a cause
of concern. These demonstrations can be nonviolent or violent, or may start as nonviolent and then turn
violent depending on the circumstances. Collecting more information about what citizens want when they
demonstrate against governments, how they demonstrate, and how governments respond allows us to analyze
the data in order to assess the political priorities of citizenries around the world.
In this study, we are interested in examining the factors that effect the likelihood of violence (both protester
and government) at protests within North America.

## Data Description
The Mass Mobilization Project has compiled a data set spanning the last three decades documenting protests
from around the world. The goal of the project is to understand citizen movements against governments and
how those governments respond. The Principle Investigators for the project are David H. Clark (Binghamton
University) and Patrick M. Regan (University of Notre Dame). The Mass Mobilization project is sponsored
by the Political Instability Task Force (PITF) which is funded by the Central Intelligence Agency.
